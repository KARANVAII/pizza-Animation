# pizza-Animation
i made this project only for learning purpose i learn a lot of things how actually work the web pages 

This is a creative front-end animation project that visually represents the process of making a pizza using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation includes interactive or visually appealing elements such as rolling the dough, adding sauce, toppings like cheese and pepperoni, and finally slicing the pizza. The goal of the project is to enhance user engagement and demonstrate animation skills using modern web technologies.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the pizza and elements.

CSS: Styling, animations, and transitions (e.g., toppings drop, cheese melt).

JavaScript (optional): For interactivity or triggering animation steps.
